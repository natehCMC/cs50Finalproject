# cs50Finalproject - Scientific Calculator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

This is a Scientific Calculator in Three parts:
1. A simple operation calculator
2. A Trignometric Calculator
3. Unit Convertion Calculator (a special Tips calculator for the american people)

**Design Choice:**
-A Simple Css Dedicated for a dark on light theme , Divided in rows. I Couldve used flask for this but since iwas unfamiliar and had little time left i chose not to and do all this in HTML,JS and Css instead.
-Making Separate Pages for each calculator and then have a simple back link for navigation.

Languages used:
1. HTML
2. JAVASCRIPT
3. CSS

**NOT USED + REASON:**
1. PYTHON: didn't have time to tinker around it
2. C: way too much work for a such a simple task
3. flask: Unfamiliar with the framework making it harder for me to keep track as of yet.
