Scientific Calculator
Overview
This Scientific Calculator project is a comprehensive tool divided into three parts, each catering to different mathematical and conversion needs. The project was implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In the interest of time constraints and familiarity, Python, C, and Flask were not utilized. The design choice involved the use of a dedicated CSS for a dark-on-light theme, ensuring a user-friendly interface. Each calculator was placed on separate pages for ease of navigation, with a simple back link for fluid movement between sections.

Components
1. Simple Operation Calculator
The simple operation calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also incorporates functions like finding square roots and percentages. The functionality is implemented using JavaScript, providing an efficient and responsive user experience.

2. Trigonometric Calculator
The trigonometric calculator enables the user to compute trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverses. Additionally, it supports degrees and radians mode for versatile usage. JavaScript is used to facilitate the execution of these complex mathematical computations accurately.

3. Unit Conversion Calculator
The unit conversion calculator is designed to seamlessly convert various units, such as length, weight, volume, and temperature, making it a versatile tool for users across different fields. The JavaScript logic behind the unit conversion ensures precise and reliable calculations, enhancing the utility of the calculator.

Design Choices
The decision to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS was primarily based on their compatibility and ease of integration. With the project's scope in mind, Python and C were deemed excessive for the required functionalities. Flask, although powerful, was not chosen due to the developer's limited familiarity, as it could have led to a longer development cycle. The choice of a dark-on-light theme with dedicated CSS aimed to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for efficient usage.

Conclusion
This Scientific Calculator project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of mathematical operations, trigonometric functions, and unit conversions. The utilization of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a simplified yet effective manner highlights the developer's ability to create a robust and user-friendly calculator tool. The project's thorough documentation in the README.md file ensures transparency and understanding for potential users and future developers.
